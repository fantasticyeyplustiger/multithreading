# Power Generator Multithreading Demo

A Java demo that simulates different types of power generators burning fuel from a given amount of resources and space. It doesn't actually have any real use, however; it's just for showcasing the usage of multithreading. OOP is also used.

Written in about five days or so total. No GUI, console only.

## Installation

Use IntelliJ's IDE for best results. Code can still be viewed regardless.

## TODO, EVENTUALLY:

Calculating overclocked power generators.
